Was bored so decided to take on the challenge of updating a menu to work on the latest patch.

[master](https://github.com/SpaghettDev/Pico-Updated/tree/master) branch has the base with some nice features added in. </br>
[base](https://github.com/SpaghettDev/Pico-Updated/tree/base) branch has the base with no modifications, but works in the latest patch.</br>
[native-ui](https://github.com/SpaghettDev/Pico-Updated/tree/native-ui) branch has modifications that make it look like a NativeUI menu.</br>
